# Hack the Hood Final Project
Dataset: Mall Customer Segmentation Data: https://kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python <br />
As someone now incredibly interested in economics, I want to research something in that field.

#2. What gender spends the least or most?  <br />
#3. What combination of age and gender spends the most? <br />
#4. What is the average income of the people going to this mall?  <br />
#5. Of the people who go to this mall, what age group has the most amount of money? <br />
#6. Of the people who go to this mall, what gender has the most amount of income?  <br />
#7. Does the person with the most income spend the most?  <br />
#8. Does the person with the least amount of income spend the least?  <br />
#9. What gender has the most amount of income on average, male or female?  <br />
